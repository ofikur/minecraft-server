## Worlds Configuration (Optional)
# Defines the default scoreboards displayed in each world.
# The plugin uses regular expressions to match world names.
# Need to test your regex? Try https://regex101.com
#
# The order is important: the first pattern that matches a world name will be used.
# It is recommended to put more specific patterns at the top.
#
# When multiple scoreboards are listed for a single world, the plugin will display
# the first one in the list for which the player meets all of its conditions.
worlds:
  # For the worlds 'pvp_arena_1' and 'pvp_arena_2', set the 'pvp' scoreboard.
  '^(pvp_arena_1|pvp_arena_2)$': [ 'pvp' ]

  # For any world starting with 'survival_', the plugin will first try to show the
  # 'survival' scoreboard. If the player doesn't meet its conditions, it will then
  # check and display the 'economy' scoreboard if its conditions are met.
  '^survival_\w+$': [ 'survival', 'economy' ]

  # Sets the 'worldTheEnd' scoreboard specifically for the default End world.
  '^world_the_end$': [ 'worldTheEnd' ]

  # The default configuration for all other worlds that don't match the above patterns.
  # This acts as a fallback to ensure all worlds have the default scoreboard.
  '[\w\s\-]*': [ 'default' ]
